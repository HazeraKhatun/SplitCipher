## Algorithm Name: SplitCipher: 
**A Cipher with 'Separate, Disorderly Join and then Hide' Technique** <br>
## Introduction
*SplitCipher* is a cryptographic algorithm that
1. Adds extra characters with the message to make its size divisible by 'key'.
2. Divides the message in 'key' number of blocks.
3. Creates primary cipher-text taking characters from the blocks in disorderly manner.
4. Then uses caesar cipher with some modifications to get final cipher text.
5. Decryption is done reversely from encryption by re-organizing the characters.
